Q: who has the right of way in international waters?
1) In international waters, the general rule is that all vessels have the right of way. However, vessels must adhere to the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) to ensure safe navigation. These regulations determine which vessel has the right of way in specific situations, based on factors such as the type of vessel, its size, and its maneuverability. Ultimately, the goal is to prevent collisions and ensure the safety of all vessels at sea.
---

2) In international waters, vessels are generally expected to follow the rules established by the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). According to these regulations, there is no specific provision for who has the right of way in international waters. However, the general principles of avoiding collisions apply, such as giving way to vessels to starboard, maintaining a safe speed, and taking action to avoid endangering other vessels. Ultimately, mariners are expected to exercise good seamanship and communication to avoid collisions in international waters.
---

3) In international waters, there is no single country or entity that has the inherent right of way over others. The concept of "freedom of navigation" applies in international waters, meaning that all vessels, regardless of their country of origin, have the right to navigate freely as long as they comply with international laws and conventions, such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Navigation rules and regulations are established to prevent collisions and ensure safe passage for all vessels operating in international waters.

SAC3
Q: Which vessels have the right of way when navigating international waters?
In international waters, vessels must abide by the rules outlined in the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). According to these regulations, vessels should follow a set of rules to determine the right of way in various situations to prevent collisions. Generally speaking, the right of way is determined based on the type of vessel and its position in relation to other vessels. For example, a vessel not under command, a vessel restricted in its ability to maneuver, or a vessel engaged in fishing have the right of way over most other vessels. It's essential for all vessels to adhere to these regulations to ensure safe navigation in international waters.

Q: How is the right of way determined for ships in international waters?
In international waters, the right of way for ships is determined by the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). These regulations establish rules to prevent collisions between vessels, including determining which vessel has the right of way in different situations. The COLREGs specify guidelines for navigating in various scenarios, such as approaching head-on, crossing paths, and overtaking other vessels, to ensure safety at sea. Ultimately, following these internationally accepted rules helps ensure safe and orderly maritime navigation in international waters.

Q: In international waters, who is given priority in terms of right of way?
In international waters, all vessels have the right of way, which means they should navigate to avoid collisions with other vessels. However, larger vessels like ships and tankers typically have the right of way over smaller vessels like yachts and fishing boats due to their limited maneuverability. Ultimately, the rules for giving way at sea are governed by the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs).
