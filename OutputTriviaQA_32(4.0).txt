Response Content: ANS: 0% JUSTIFICATION: The two lists provided describe distinct historical events and developments related to Portugal, spanning different time periods. The first list covers events from the late 16th to the mid-17th centuries related to the dynastic crisis, the restoration of the monarchy, and independence from foreign rule. The second list discusses events from the 11th to the 12th centuries concerning the early formation and recognition of the Kingdom of Portugal. There are no specific names or individuals appearing in both lists since they refer to entirely separate historical contexts. Thus, there is no overlap in names between the two lists.

Response Content: ANS: 50% JUSTIFICATION: Both lists discuss the same historical sequence of events relating to Portugal, focusing on the period of Spanish rule under the Iberian Union and the subsequent Restoration which led to independence. Specifically, overlapping names and events include the Restoration War (1640-1668), the Acclamation of King John IV, and the Treaty of Lisbon (1668). Both mention the critical moment when the Duke of Braganza became King John IV. Therefore, the overlap is significant in terms of subject matter and key figures but does not include every detail or event listed in both groups, leading to an estimated overlap of about 50%.

The total number of unique names combined is 16 (12+10-6).
The overlap is calculated by the formula: (Number of overlapping names / Total number of unique names) * 100 = (6/13) * 100 ≈ 61.54%.

Response Content: ANS: 60% JUSTIFICATION: There are 10 names in each list. The overlapping names, ignoring minor variations, are: Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey, Kanye West (listed twice in the first list but counted once for overlap), Robin Williams, Harrison Ford, Bill Murray, and Jennifer Hudson. Thus, there are 7 overlapping names. Calculating the percentage of overlap involves dividing the number of unique overlapping names by the total number of names in each list, which is 10. This yields a 70% overlap. However, considering Kanye West appeared twice in the first list but only once in the second, we adjust for unique matching occurrences down to 6 across both lists, resulting in a 60% overlap when calculated correctly based on unique occurrences across both lists (7 out of the possible unique 12 names: 13 unique when merging lists, minus duplicates: Kanye's dual count).

Response Content: ANS: 91% JUSTIFICATION: Both lists are essentially the same, containing the same set of names, though there are some minor variations such as additional descriptions or formats (like the use of quotes). Ignoring those minor differences, there are 11 common names out of the 12 total unique names listed. Therefore, the overlap is roughly calculated as \( \frac{11}{12} \times 100 = 91.67\% \). Rounded down, this results in 91% overlap.
